# Introduction 
Data Hub and Posting Group provide a frame work for managing the ingress and egress of data from a system and the orchestration of processes that depend on the data. Please check the wiki for additional information. https://github.com/dataalias/Control/wiki

# Getting Started
Data Hub and Posting Group database projects are intended to be installed on SQL Server (2008+). Stored proceudrees can be used to insert metadata to allow for the load of data sets into a target database.

# Build and Test
This code can be built with Visual Studio (2017+). The repository also contains two test scripts to demonstrate the database components have been installed correctly.
